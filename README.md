## Detections

Osprey blocks websites that are classified as:

- [Malicious](https://us.norton.com/blog/malware/what-are-malicious-websites)
- [Phishing](https://f-secure.com/us-en/articles/what-is-phishing)
- [Fraud](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/scam-websites)
- [PUAs](https://us.norton.com/blog/malware/what-are-puas-potentially-unwanted-applications)
- [Cryptojacking](https://kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptojacking)
- [Malvertising](https://malwarebytes.com/malvertising)
- [Compromised](https://malwarebytes.com/glossary/compromised)
- [Untrusted](https://mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/how-to-tell-whether-a-website-is-safe-or-unsafe)
- [Restricted](https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/mass-media-society/adult-content) (Adult Content)

## Warning

If the website is malicious, Osprey will block the page and display a warning:

![Osprey Warning](https://i.imgur.com/FAx4lb9.png)

From this page, you can report the website as safe, temporarily allow the website, go back to safety, and continue
anyway. By default, Osprey creates a browser notification for blocked pages that
[you can toggle on and off](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/wiki/Toggling-Notifications) using the context menu.
You can hide the continue and report buttons, lock down the protection options, and even hide the context menu
entirely using [the system policies](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/wiki/Setting-Up-System-Policies).

## Settings

You can configure the extension's protection options in the settings:

- [OpenDNS Family Shield DNS](https://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security)

Providers disabled by default are either due to:

- Frequent reports of false positives
- Failure to respond to false positive reports
- Being an optional adult content filter

If a provider gives you false positives, report the links to them directly and disable them in the Protection Options
panel if needed. Osprey is designed to be customizable, so you can enable or disable any of the providers at any time.
Osprey does not have control over the providers' databases or how they classify URLs.

## Privacy

Osprey strips down each URL of tracking parameters before sending it to any APIs.

For example:

1. If you search for shirts on Amazon and
   visit: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=shirts&crid=3TOVSW14ZHF8V&sprefix=shirt%2Caps%2C175&ref=nb_sb_noss_1
2. Osprey will only send https://amazon.com/s to any APIs you have enabled.
3. If the APIs report that the page is safe to visit, Osprey caches the result for 24 hours.
4. It will also be cached if you click 'Continue anyway' or 'Temporarily allow this website' on a blocked site.
5. As long as a URL is cached, no new network requests will be made for it.

The only data the APIs receive is the stripped-down URL, your user agent, and your IP address. Use a reputable VPN or
proxy service if you're concerned about IP-related privacy. There are also extensions that mask your user agent, if
you're so inclined.

As for why Osprey needs to check complete URLs instead of just the domain, many phishing attacks use legitimate
companies to host their phishing campaigns, such as Jotform. If Osprey only checked a website's domain name, it wouldn't
detect those threats. Osprey only sends your hostname to its various DNS API providers, so if you're highly concerned
about URL page privacy, the DNS APIs are there for you.
